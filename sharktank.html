	<p>Plastic bottles are a serious environmental problem and there is a lot of pressure to reduce them. A few solutions involve upcycling and downcycling. Upcycling is a creative way to turn items that would otherwise be unused into funvtional and useful things. Downcycling is the process of stripping down items to component parts with less inherent value than the original. But there are also some non-recyclable items so it's best to refraim from using them whenever possible. There is always a way to creatively use items instead of trashing it. For example, you can use plastic bottles to make garden sprinkler, a bird feeder or a watering can.</p>
